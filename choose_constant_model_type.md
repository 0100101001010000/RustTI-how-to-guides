# How to determine the best `ConstantModelType` for a RustTI function

This guide shows how to progamatically determine the best `ConstantModelType` for your indicator.

The rating model is overly simplified and should be refined to suit your needs before usage.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Determine the best `ConstantModelType` for the RSI from a year of data

> This guide uses knowledge established in the [load csv](./load_csv.md) guide.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Add the following dependencies to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
csv = "1"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
chrono = "0.4"
rust_ti = "2.1"
```

---

## ðŸ’» Step-by-Step

### 1. Get data from CSV

[See load csv guide](./load_csv.md) if you need a refresher here.

### 2. Calculate the RSI for multiple periods

The default model for the RSI is a Smoothed Moving Average (SMA)

We will store the models we are interested in into a Vec and iterate over it to calculate the RSI.

In this guide we will skip the Personalised Moving Average as it is cover in an [other guide](./personliased_moving_average.md)

```rust

use rust_ti::ConstantModelType;

[...]

let models = vec![
    ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingAverage, ConstantModelType::SmoothedMovingAverage,
    ConstantModelType::ExponentialMovingAverage, ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingMedian,
    ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingMode
];

for m in models.iter() {
    let rsi = relative_strenght_index(&prices, *m, 14);
}

[...]

```

### 3. Rate each different RSI to find the best

> The logic is overly simple for the purpose of the guide.

If the RSI is over 70 (overbought) and the next price < current price, the model gets a `+1`

If the RSI is under 30 (oversold) and the next price > current price, the model gets a `+1`


```rust

let models = vec![
    ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingAverage, ConstantModelType::SmoothedMovingAverage,
    ConstantModelType::ExponentialMovingAverage, ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingMedian,
    ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingMode
];

let mut best_rating = 0.0;
let mut best_model = ConstantModelType::SimpleMovingAverage;

for m in models.iter() {
    let rsi = relative_strengtih_index(&prices, *m, 14);
   
    let mut current_rating = 0.0;
    let mut attempt = 0.0;
    for i in 14..data.len() - 1 { 
        let rsi_val = rsi[i - 14]; 

        // If RSI > 70, overbought, price is expected to fall, if that happens +1 reward
        if rsi_val > 70.0 {
            attempt += 1.0;
            if prices[i + 1] < prices[i] {
                current_rating += 1.0;
            }
        }

        // If RSI < 30, oversold, price is expected to rise, if that happens +1 reward
        if rsi_val < 30.0 {
            attempt += 1.0;
            if prices[i + 1] > prices[i] {
                current_rating += 1.0;
            }
        }
     }
    // The shorter the period the more RSIs, so the more opportunities to be right,
    // for fairness we divide by the number of attempts
    let average_rating = current_rating / attempt;
    if average_rating > best_rating {
        best_rating = average_rating;
        best_model = *m;
    }
}

println!(
    "Best model for RSI is {:?} with a rating of {}",
    best_model, best_rating
);

[...]

```

## ðŸ§ª Output

> to run the repo example `cargo run --example choose_constant_model_type < data.csv`

```shell
Loaded 251 prices
Best model for RSI is SimpleMovingAverage with a rating of 0.5625
```

## âœ… Next Steps

- [Programatically choose a period](./choose_period.md) 
- Combine period selection and constant type model selection
- Introduce the notion of punishment to the rating system
